# Vehicle License Plate Recognition

This project uses OpenCV and EasyOCR to recognize and print the license plate from a vehicle image.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a simple yet effective license plate recognition system using OpenCV for image processing and EasyOCR for optical character recognition (OCR). The system takes an image of a vehicle as input and outputs the recognized license plate number.

## Features

- Detect and isolate the license plate from a vehicle image
- Recognize and print the license plate number
- Easy to use and integrate into other projects

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
